# BlackJack
This program simulates a black jack game with the user playing the computer. The player will go first and can draw cards until they bust (go over 21). Then the computer plays and will draw until it reaches the value of 15. 

When the cards run out, the program will generate a new deck and shuffle it. 

The player and computer start with 10 cherries and bet one each time until there is a winner who gets all 20. The user can choose to play another game but can also choose to quit after any round.
